# iOS Design Stencils for OmniGraffle

A stencil for designing iOS applications for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch devices. The stencil was created a developer for developers and provides the views, controls and symbols in UIKit. All stencils are **originally created by hand from native or custom created OmniGraffle shapes** and grouped for ease of use. Stencils can be easily scaled to new point resolutions and exported to any vector formats supported in OmniGraffle.

## Notes

* Stencil canvas settings are in points and 1pt = 1pt unit scale.

* Major and minor grid settings are set to 10 x 10 pts. I've found this the most effective grid size setting.

* Bar button items use Apple Symbols font glyphs. Vector versions of these symbols are in the works.
